# assignment
My project is based on Petrol consumption per country.
I have the data for 50 countries from 2013 and 1980. I have two bar graphs to repersent the two years (option 1 and 2). Option 3 is my own graph which is a bubble graph on the map of the world. All scalled up. My fourth option is a trend graph of the top 4 countries (America, China, Japan, India) in 2013. 

My assignment is also controlled by the makey makey. Each option is controlled by either a pice of metal, fruit or play doh. 

The website I used for reference is http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/country.cfm?iso=USA.
